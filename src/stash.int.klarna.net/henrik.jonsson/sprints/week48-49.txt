# Sprint week47 - 48 retrospective

- Just getting started, might be less structured than some circles (file our own
  tickets)
- Spartak was working on communications sendouts, present for some kickoff sessions
  but didn't have time to help out with development
- Might not need huge amount of structure, c.f. ShuHaRi
- Business processes around mapping issues and sending reconciliation reports fully
  handed off to Maria at this point (last parts merged with Mariana's help)
- Accrued interest is progressing, found issues that forced us to rework prototype
- Retrodated checks is at risk for EOY, even if our parts were done we also need
  accrued interest to be live in production first, and some significant validation
  from business perspective that the cutover will not lose or double-count postings
